Your posts are located in `content/_posts` directory. The naming format is as follows: `RRRR-MM-DD-Article-title.md`.
Title from file name is used in published URL of the post. You can customize the actual title in the "front matter".
In addition to that, you can include image of your choosing, assign a tag and specify author on per post basis.
To do so, the beginning of your post need to be as follows:

```yaml
---
title: Definitive guide to catching squirrels
author: John Doe
img: https://placekitten.com/300/300
tag: Post
published: true
---
```

You can now write your content freely. Remember to include one clean line of spacing between content and front matter.
